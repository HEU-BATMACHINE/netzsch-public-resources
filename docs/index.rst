It aims to standardize terminology, enhance data interoperability, and facilitate semantic reasoning over machinery-generated data.

The usage is aimged at esearchers, engineers, and stakeholders involved in battery manufacturing processes can use this ontology to:

- Standardize terminology for machinery-generated data  
- Integrate heterogeneous data sources  
- Enable semantic search and reasoning over machinery-generated data  
- Facilitate the development of data-driven analytics and decision support systems
